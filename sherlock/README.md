  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        If using single username, the output of the result will be saved
                        to this file.
  --tor, -t             Make requests over Tor; increases runtime; requires Tor to be
                        installed and in system path.
  --unique-tor, -u      Make requests over Tor with new Tor circuit after each request;
                        increases runtime; requires Tor to be installed and in system
                        path.

To search for only one user:
```
python3 sherlock user123
```

To search for more than one user:
```
python3 sherlock user1 user2 user3
```

Accounts found will be stored in an individual text file with the corresponding username (e.g ```user123.txt```).

## Anaconda (Windows) Notes

If you are using Anaconda in Windows, using 'python3' might not work. Use 'python' instead.

## Docker Notes

If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

```
docker build -t mysherlock-image .
```

Once the image is built, sherlock can be invoked by running the following:

```
docker run --rm -t mysherlock-image user123
```

The optional ```--rm``` flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm

The optional ```-t``` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground

Use the following command to access the saved results:

```
docker run --rm -t -v "$PWD/results:/opt/sherlock/results" mysherlock-image -o /opt/sherlock/results/text.txt user123
```

The ```-v "$PWD/results:/opt/sherlock/results"``` options tell docker to create (or use) the folder `results` in the
present working directory and to mount it at `/opt/sherlock/results` on the docker container.
The `-o /opt/sherlock/results/text.txt` option tells `sherlock` to output the result.

Or you can use "Docker Hub" to run `sherlock`:
```
docker run theyahya/sherlock user123
```

### Using `docker-compose`

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository and use this command:

```
docker-compose run sherlock -o /opt/sherlock/results/text.txt user123
```

## Contributing
We would love to have you help us with the development of Sherlock. Each and every contribution is greatly valued!

Here are some things we would appreciate your help on:
- Addition of new site support ¹
- Bringing back site support of [sites that have been removed](removed_sites.md) in the past due to false positives

[1] Please look at the Wiki entry on [adding new sites](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/wiki/Adding-Sites-To-Sherlock)
to understand the issues.

## Tests

Thank you for contributing to Sherlock!

Before creating a pull request with new development, please run the tests
to ensure that everything is working great.  It would also be a good idea to run the tests
before starting development to distinguish problems between your
environment and the Sherlock software.

The following is an example of the command line to run all the tests for
Sherlock.  This invocation hides the progress text that Sherlock normally
outputs, and instead shows the verbose output of the tests.

```
$ cd sherlock/sherlock
$ python3 -m unittest tests.all --verbose
```

Note that we do currently have 100% test coverage.  Unfortunately, some of
the sites that Sherlock checks are not always reliable, so it is common
to get response problems.  Any problems in connection will show up as
warnings in the tests instead of true errors.

If some sites are failing due to connection problems (site is down, in maintenance, etc)
you can exclude them from tests by creating a `tests/.excluded_sites` file with a
list of sites to ignore (one site name per line).
